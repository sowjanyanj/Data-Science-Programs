Program List:
1. Consider the auto-mpg dataset and perform exploratory data analysis. 
 a. Identify the dimension, structure, and summary of the data set 
 b. Plot the histogram for variables
 c. Recognize the outliers using box plot (Display the box plot before and after outlier treatment)
 d. Check for “na” and treat them 
 Standardize the continuous variable (if any)
2. For the data set in Q1,
 a. Show the distribution of continuous variables using histogram
 b. Identify two continuous variables using scatter plot 
 c. Find and display the frequency of the categorical values using count plot
 d.Apply point plots to display one continuous and one categorical variable
3. Consider the health care dataset that consists of several imaging details from patients that had a 
 biopsy to test for breast cancer. The variable diagnosis classifies the biopsied tissue as M = 
 malignant or B = benign. Use KNN supervised learning model to predict Diagnosis using 
 texture_mean and radius_mean . Analyze the model using different k values and display the 
 performance of the model.
4. Consider the student_performance dataset. Predict the student performance as “Pass” or “Fail” by 
 implementing a decision tree. Identify the important feature affecting the student performance and 
 analyze the efficiency of the decision tree using different metrics. Plot the decision tree.
5. For the dataset in Q4, apply random forest algorithm to predict the student performance. 
 a. Plot the important variables using seaborn
 b. Tune the random forest for training and test data based on best parameters and implement it 
 c. Analyze the model performance and display the output
6. For the market_basket dataset, apply apriori algorithm and identify the best rules based on support 
 and confidence values.
7. For the Mall-Customers dataset Implement k-means clustering algorithm and visualize the 
 clusters
8. Consider the given text dataset. Implement different text processing techniques and identify the 
 most important keywords from the text. Display a word cloud from the same. 
9. Consider the iris dataset and apply the Multilayer perceptron to classify the type of the flower. 
 Analyze the performance of the perceptron and display the output. 
10. Consider the MNIST data set and implement CNN architecture to identify the handwritten images. 
 Optimize the model and display the output.
